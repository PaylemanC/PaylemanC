## :dart: Focus...

I study all the time about technologies, design patterns, software architecture, algorithms, soft-skills, UX/UI design, web accesibility, frameworks & libraries, complementary tools such as Git and GitHub, and more. I'm mostly a self-taught, formally I study the Tecnicatura Superior en Desarrollo Web y Aplicaciones Digitales (Web Development and Digital Applications) at the Instituto Superior Polit√©cnico de C√≥rdoba (a higher education institute, 3 years).

My currently obsession is JavaScript :yellow_heart: So I'm learning Node and React in order to reach the MERN stack, but I also study Python for Data Science, Java to understanding OOP, and Angular as an alternative to React. 

I also read and practice a lot about web accesibility: I understand assistive technologies like screen readers, semantic HTML and aria-labels, manage Chrome Devtools and Lighthouse to testing, etc.  And UX/UI desing: I use Figma for user interface design and app prototypes, manage terminology of design area, apply Gestalt principles and laws of UX to projects, etc.

I would like to learn Mobile App Development on the near future (React Native maybe?) :iphone:

## :video_game: Hobbies...

If I'm not studying or doing a project, I'm reading a thriller e-book (with detectives writted by Arthur Conan Doyle or suspense crimes by John Katzenbach), or playing mobile MOBAs, or losing my shit due to AWESOME fanarts and UI desings & website ideas on Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Between my hobbies and profession, I like to listening to playlists with the pomodoro study technique where there's calm piano & jazz and charming landscapes on background, on YouTube.
