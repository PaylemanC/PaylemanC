<h1 align="center"> Hello world, I'm PaylemanC :woman_technologist::wave: </h1>

* :woman_technologist: I'm Full Stack Developer Jr.
* :argentina: I'm from C√≥rdoba, Argentina. Vivo tomando mate :mate:
* :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: I'm a native speaker of Spanish but I speak fluent English. I'm English teacher too! :woman_teacher:
* :two::one: I'm 21 years old. 
* :heartpulse: Studying & Website Development are my greatest passions :computer:	:books:

I study all the time about technologies, design patterns, software architecture, algorithms, soft-skills, UX/UI design, web accesibility, frameworks & libraries, complementary tools such as Git and GitHub, and more. I'm mostly a self-taught, formally I study the Tecnicatura Superior en Desarrollo Web y Aplicaciones Digitales (Web Development and Digital Applications) at the Instituto Superior Polit√©cnico de C√≥rdoba (a higher education institute, 3 years).

My currently obsession is JavaScript :yellow_heart: So I'm learning Node and React in order to reach the MERN stack, but I also study Python for Data Science, Java to understanding OOP, and Angular as an alternative to React. 

I also read and practice a lot about web accesibility: I understand assistive technologies like screen readers, semantic HTML and aria-labels, manage Chrome Devtools and Lighthouse to testing, etc.  And UX/UI desing: I use Figma for user interface design and app prototypes, manage terminology of design area, apply Gestalt principles and laws of UX to projects, etc.

I would like to learn Mobile App Development on the near future (React Native maybe?) :iphone:
